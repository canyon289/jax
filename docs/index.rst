JAX reference documentation
===========================

JAX is Autograd_ and XLA_, brought together for high-performance numerical computing and machine learning research.
It provides composable transformations of Python+NumPy programs: differentiate, vectorize,
parallelize, Just-In-Time compile to GPU/TPU, and more.

.. note::
   JAX 0.4.1 introduces new parallelism APIs, including breaking changes to :func:`jax.experimental.pjit` and a new unified ``jax.Array`` type.
   Please see `Distributed arrays and automatic parallelization <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Distributed_arrays_and_automatic_parallelization.html>`_ tutorial and the :ref:`jax-array-migration`
   guide for more information.
